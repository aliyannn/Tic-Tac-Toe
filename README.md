## <a name="introduction">üêæ Introduction</a>
This repository contains a web-based Tic Tac Toe game where a human player competes against an AI. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring smooth transitions, animations, and a time limit for each move.

## <a name="features">üîç Features</a>
* Player vs AI: Compete against a computer opponent using the minimax algorithm.
* Smooth Transitions: Smooth fading and animation effects for an engaging user experience.
* Move Timer: Each player has 15 seconds to make a move, adding urgency to the game.
* Responsive Design: Adjusts layout and sizes for different screen sizes for a better experience on both mobile and desktop.
* Stylish Interface: Custom fonts and colors for an appealing and modern design.

## <a name="techused">üíª Technologies Used</a>
* HTML: Structure of the game.
* CSS: Styling, including animations and transitions.
* JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.

## <a name="codeexp">üìù Code Explanation</a>
### 1) <a name="html-structure">HTML Structure</a>
* Header and Messages: The h1, h2, and h6 elements provide the game title and instructions.
* Form: Radio buttons allow the player to choose their mark (X or O).
* Grid: The (ul id="grid") element is where the game grid will be dynamically created.
* JavaScript: Linked through <script src="index.js"></script> to handle game logic.

### 2) <a name="javascript">JavaScript Functionality</a>
#### The JavaScript code manages the game logic, including player and AI moves, animations, and timing.
#### Variables and Initialization:
* Elements: grid, msg, and chooser are DOM elements.
* Game State: playerMark, computerMark, cells, and board manage the game state.
* Timers: playerTimer and computerTimer manage move timing.
* Constants: moveTimeLimit sets the 15-second move limit.

#### Setting the Player's Mark:
* Event Handling: Sets playerMark and computerMark based on player choice.
* Animations: Adds fade-out and fade-in classes for smooth transitions.
* Game Setup: Calls buildGrid() to create the game grid and starts the player's move timer.

#### Building the Game Grid:
* Grid Creation: Dynamically creates the 3x3 grid and attaches playerMove event listeners to each cell.

### Handling Player Moves:
#### The playerMove function is triggered when the player clicks on a cell. Here's the detailed breakdown:
#### Keypoints: 

#### i) Check Turn and Cell State:
* if (isPlayerTurn && event.target.textContent === ' '): Ensures it's the player's turn and the clicked cell is empty.

####  ii) Update UI and State:
* event.target.textContent = playerMark;: Sets the player's mark (X or O) in the clicked cell.
* animateMove(event.target);: Adds an animation to the cell.
* let index = cells.indexOf(event.target);: Gets the index of the clicked cell.
* board[index] = playerMark;: Updates the internal game board state.

#### iii) Change Turn and Manage Timers:
* isPlayerTurn = false;: Switches the turn to the computer.
* disableGrid();: Disables the grid to prevent further player interaction until the computer moves.
* clearTimeout(playerTimer);: Clears the player's move timer.

#### iv) Check for Winner and Trigger Computer Move:
* if (!checkWinner(board)): Checks if the player has won. If not, updates the message and triggers the computer's move after a delay to simulate thinking time.
After the computer's move, checks again for a winner and updates the message.

### Handling AI Moves:
#### The computerMove function determines and makes the best move for the AI using the minimax algorithm. Here's the breakdown:
#### Keypoints:

#### i) Initialize Variables:
* let bestScore = -Infinity;: Sets the initial best score to a very low value.
* let moveIndex;: Variable to store the index of the best move.

#### ii) Find the Best Move:
* Loops through each cell in the board.
* If the cell is empty, makes a temporary move for the computer.
* Uses minimax to evaluate the score of this move.
* Reverts the move.
* Updates bestScore and moveIndex if this move has a better score.

#### iii) Make the move:
* Sets the computer's mark in the best cell.
* Updates the board and UI.
* Animates the move.

#### iv) Switch Turn and Manage Timers:
* Switches the turn back to the player.
* Enables the grid for the player.
* Starts the player's timer.

#### v) Check for Winner:
* Checks if the computer has won. If not, returns true to indicate the game continues.

### Minimax Algorithm:
#### The minimax function is a recursive algorithm used to determine the optimal move for the AI. Here's the breakdown:
#### Keypoints:

#### i) Check for Terminal States:
* let result = checkWinner(board, true);: Checks if the game has a winner or is a tie.
* If there is a result, returns a score based on who won or if it's a tie:
* AI win: 10 - depth (favors quicker wins).
* Player win: depth - 10 (penalizes quicker losses).
* Tie: 0.

#### ii) Maximizing Player (AI):
* if (isMaximizing): When it's the AI's turn.
* Initializes bestScore to a very low value.

#### iii) Loops through each cell:
* If the cell is empty, makes a temporary move for the AI.
* Recursively calls minimax to get the score of this move.
* Reverts the move.
* Updates bestScore with the maximum of the current best score and the new score.

#### iv) Minimizing Player (Human):
* else: When it's the player's turn.
* Initializes bestScore to a very high value.

#### v) Loops through each cell:
* If the cell is empty, makes a temporary move for the player.
* Recursively calls minimax to get the score of this move.
* Reverts the move.
* Updates bestScore with the minimum of the current best score and the new score.

#### vi) Return Best Score:
* Returns the best score found for the current player (AI or human).

#### NOTE: By using the minimax algorithm, the AI evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes, ensuring it makes the optimal move to either win or draw the game. This ensures a challenging opponent for the player.

#### Checking for a Winner:
* Winning Patterns: Checks predefined patterns to determine if there's a winner.
* UI Updates: Highlights winning cells and displays the winner or tie message.

#### Move Timing and Animation:
* Move Timer: Starts a timer for the player's move, declaring the computer the winner if time runs out.
* Animations: Adds a pulse animation to the cell to indicate a move.

#### Utility Functions:
* Grid State Management: Enables and disables the grid based on game state.

### 3) <a name="css-styling">CSS Styling</a>
* Overall Style: Sets the font, colors, and layout for the game.
* Transitions and Animations: Smooth transitions for fade effects and pulse animation for moves.
* Responsive Design: Adjusts layout to be centered and maintains a clean, simple look.
